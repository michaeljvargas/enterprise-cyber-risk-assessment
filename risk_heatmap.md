# Risk Prioritization (Heat Map Logic)

## Priority Bands
- Critical: 20–25
- High: 15–19
- Medium: 8–14
- Low: 1–7

## Top Priorities
1) R-01 Credential stuffing (Score 20): high likelihood, direct fraud loss, impacts customers immediately.  
2) R-02 Account takeover via no MFA (Score 20): high impact, high reputational and financial risk.  
3) R-06 Insufficient logging (Score 16): reduces detection and response capability across multiple threats.

## Why These Come First
They combine (a) high probability, (b) direct financial loss, and (c) broad control leverage. Improving MFA, logging, and detection reduces multiple risks at once.
