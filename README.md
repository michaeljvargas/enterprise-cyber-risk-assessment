# Enterprise Cyber Risk Assessment (Financial Services App)

## Objective
This project demonstrates a practical, enterprise-style cyber risk assessment for a cloud-based financial services application. The focus is on identifying key assets, credible threat scenarios, risk scoring, and mapping recommended controls to widely used frameworks (NIST CSF, CIS Controls).

## Visual Artifacts
- [Cyber Risk Heat Map (PDF)](diagrams/Cyber_Risk_Heat_Map.pdf)
- 
## Contents
- `executive_summary.md` – 1-page executive overview of key risks and priorities
- `system_overview.md` – system scope, assets, data types, trust boundaries
- `threat_model.md` – threat scenarios, attack paths, and impacted assets
- `data/risk_register.csv` – risk register with likelihood/impact scoring and mitigations
- `control_mapping.md` – mapping risks to preventive and detective controls (NIST/CIS)
- `risk_heatmap.md` – prioritization logic for high-impact risks
- `assumptions.md` – assumptions and scope boundaries

## Frameworks Used
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)
- CIS Critical Security Controls

## Notes
This is an educational project intended to demonstrate risk analysis methodology and security control reasoning.
